#  Pok√©mon EDA Dashboard Project

Welcome to my first end-to-end data analytics project, where I explore the full Pok√©mon dataset across Generations 1‚Äì8. Using a combination of SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau, I analyzed trends in stats, typing, growth patterns, and more to generate actionable insights and visual storytelling.

This project aims to demonstrate my capabilities as an entry-level data analyst through data wrangling, visualization, and insight communication.

##  Tools Used
- **SQL** (data wrangling and export)
- **Python** (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib` for EDA and static visualizations)
- **Excel** (data cleaning, preprocessing)
- **Tableau** (interactive dashboards)

This dashboard includes multiple tabs visualizing:
- Stats by type
- Population growth
- Dual-type patterns
- Catch rates
- Growth rate distributions

## ‚úÖ Project Objectives

1. Identify top-performing Pok√©mon by analyzing base stats.
2. Visualize population growth across generations.
3. Explore dual-type trends and frequency.
4. Compare stat averages by Pok√©mon classification.
5. Discover stat distribution trends across generations.
6. Investigate the relationship between strength and catch rate.
7. Compare single vs. dual-type Pok√©mon performance.
8. Analyze Pok√©mon growth rate patterns by type.
9. List the top 10 strongest Pok√©mon by total stats.
10. Identify top Pok√©mon per individual stat.

## üìà Key Insights

### 1. Top-Performing Pok√©mon Types
- Dragon-types have the highest average total stats (~50 points above second place).
- Highest averages by stat:  
  - **Attack**: Dragon  
  - **Special Attack**: Psychic  
  - **Defense**: Steel  
- Type pairings with Dragon, Psychic, or Steel consistently rank highest.

### 2. Pok√©mon Population Growth
- Generation 1 introduced the most Pok√©mon (192).
- Generations 2‚Äì5 each added 100+ Pok√©mon.
- Generations 6‚Äì8 show a declining trend (all under 100).

### 3. Dual-Type Distribution
- Generations 6 and 7 have more dual-type Pok√©mon.
- Most frequent combos: Flying/Normal, Grass/Poison, Bug/Flying.
- Bug and Dark types have the most unique pairings.

### 4. Stats by Classification
- Legendary Pok√©mon lead across all stat categories.
- Mythicals lean offensive; Sub-Legendaries are more defensive.
- Normal Pok√©mon are weakest on average.

### 5. Stat Trends by Generation
- Generation 2 has the highest average Attack.
- Speed is the lowest on average across all generations.

### 6. Catch Rate vs. Strength
- Moderate-to-strong negative correlation (-0.62) between base stats and catch rate.
- Stronger Pok√©mon are generally harder to catch.
- Outlier: **Eternamax Eternatus** (highest stats and catch rate due to story requirement).

### 7. Type-Based Stat Performance
- Dual-types have higher average total stats than single-types.

### 8. Growth Rate Distribution
- Medium Fast is most common (Normal, Water, Electric).
- Medium Slow follows (Grass, Fire, Water).
- Dragon-types mostly have Slow growth.
- Water-types are the most evenly distributed.

### 9. Top 10 Strongest Pok√©mon
1. **Eternamax Eternatus** ‚Äì 1125  
2. **Mega Mewtwo Y/X**, **Mega Rayquaza** ‚Äì 780  
3. **Primal Kyogre**, **Primal Groudon** ‚Äì 770  
4. **Ultra Necrozma** ‚Äì 754  
5. **Zacian (Crowned)**, **Zamazenta (Crowned)**, **Arceus** ‚Äì 720  

### 10. Top Pok√©mon by Stat
- **HP**: Blissey, Eternamax Eternatus (255)  
- **Attack**: Mega Mewtwo X (190)  
- **Defense**: Eternamax Eternatus (250)  
- **Special Attack**: Mega Mewtwo Y (194)  
- **Special Defense**: Eternamax Eternatus (250)  
- **Speed**: Deoxys (Speed Forme) (180)

## ‚úÖ Recommendations & Future Analysis

### üîß Actionable Insights
- Prioritize Dragon, Psychic, and Steel types for high-performing teams.
- Use dual-types for stronger overall stat distributions.
- Expect tougher capture rates for high-stat Pok√©mon ‚Äî prepare accordingly.
- Focus on Medium Fast growth rate Pok√©mon for faster leveling.

### üîç Future Analysis Ideas
- Include abilities and natures to evaluate competitive viability.
- Analyze movesets and versatility by type and stat synergy.
- Study EV/IV distributions for deeper performance insights.
- Add Gen 9 data and regional forms when available.
- Compare usage rates in competitive formats (e.g., Smogon tiers).
